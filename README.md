# Tech Skills Matrix

Skills matrix to evaluate **tech** skills of BA engineers.  
Soft skills are important as well, but they are not included in this matrix.

## How to use?

You are welcome to use this matrix as reference in your
There are 2 options to use this matrix:

1. Open in GitHub pages (recommended): https://infopulse.github.io/Tech-Skills-Matrix-BA
2. Check out every skill category in markdown files: (will be updated)
   - [Types of requirements](matrix/01.md) - Estimations, tasks prioritization, test documentation, test management, risk management

- Review required skills for each level and category
- Give yourself honest feedback if you know well enough each skill (In future releases we will provide a self-assessment tool)

We encourage you to use this matrix in your companies to align the skills and knowledge of QA engineers worldwide.

## Rules

As a company we expect that:

1. every BA Engineer who claims a specific seniority level must have at least 7 basic skill categories not less than this level
2. every next seniority level includes skills and knowledge of all previous levels
3. tech skills are generalized to apply to a wide range of engineers
4. the matrix is used both for internal QA engineers and for [hiring purposes](https://www.infopulse.com/join-us?specialization=9)

## Roadmap

It is good to measure the skills using the matrix, but it is even better to have a guide on how to improve the skills
and gain new knowledge.

- Checkout this roadmap as possible reference: https://roadmap.sh/qa
